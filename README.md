# Random Password Generator

## Purpose
The purpose of this web page is to generate a random password for the user. The user will choose the length of their password (between 8 and 128 characters) Then they will be given the options to choose if they want to include uppercase characters, lowercase characters, special characters, and/or numbers. The password generator will then give the user a password length that they've chosen containing the types of characters that they have chosen.
